This is a small project I created to experiment with OpenCV Face Recognition classifiers presets.

Interesting observations:

- "haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml" seems to be generally better than "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml"
since it does not false recognise arcimboldo.jpg. Try it with "arcimboldo.jpg".

- "haarcascade_profileface.xml" and the other two tend to point to the same regions if the value of
"minNeighbors" in "detectMultiScale" in "Module.py" is low enough. Try setting it at 5 and running a script with "two_people.jpg".
